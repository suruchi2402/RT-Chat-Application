# RT-Chat-Application
# <a href="https://nodejs-chat-app2.herokuapp.com/">Live Demo</a>
A Web application where users can communicate with others (specifically in a group). To create this chat application I've used a javascript library called **Socket.io** that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. I've also used **Node.js** web application framework called **Express**. it provides the set of features to develop the web and mobile applications.
